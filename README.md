# Bank Loan Approval Web Application
### Introduction
This projects aim was to encapsulate all of my current working knowledge of python,
data science and web development.

What this project achieves is the ability for a user to input their personal details
and see whether they would be approved for a loan or not. When thinking of a project
to tackle I most of all wanted to make something with real world use instead of a web
app that can determine a cat from a dog (although that was my first idea), I am keen on entering
the Fintech space and that's why this project leans more towards finance. Although there are many
tweaks and extras that could be added, I wanted to get the general message out that I am capable
and comfortable working with both front end and back end.

### Technologies
Django
Django Rest Framework
Jquery
HTML
CSS
Docker
Heroku (Deployment)

### Conclusion
My closing words are this. There are many tutorials on machine learning as a whole and how to create
models, but very few on how to productionise them. Tackling this project gave me the opportunity to
learn how to do that. My takeaways from this project are as follows:
- Django's file structure and templating
- Django rest framework
- Unit testing
- Creating and testing ML function in Google Colab
- Dockerizing a Django project
- Deploying a web application
- Reading and understanding both Django and Jquery errors

Please note: "Property Area", "Self Employed", "Loan Amount", "Loan Term" and 
most of all "Credit History". Play a big role in your prediction. Have fun!
